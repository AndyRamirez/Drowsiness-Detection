# Drowsiness-Detection

## Summary
In this project a drowsiness detector is implemented using YOLO. The training was performed with near infrared images. 
This project was developed in python programming language. 
The problem of drowsiness is something very common in people who perform activities such as surveillance, driving vehicles, among other activities  [^1]. Because of this, several algorithms based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect drowsiness states.

## Problem Formulation
Drowsiness in drivers has been one of the main causes of traffic accidents [^2].
1.35 million deaths due to road accidents in 2016 worldwide [^3].
 
In Mexico, road accidents in 2015 were 378,232 [^4].

87% of road accidents are due to the driver [^2].

Studies from various countries show fatigue as responsible for between 20-30% of accidents occurring on highways [^2][^5].
